DiZyme: an open-access expandable resource for quantitative prediction of nanozyme catalytic activity <br>
Web-resource https://dizyme.net/
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
The DiZyme resource contains a built-in expandable database of nanozymes with links to original articles, an interactive clickable tool for its visualization, and a machine learning models for various levels of user requests (base, progressive and advanced) capable of predicting catalytic activity represented as the Michaelis-Menten (K<sub>m</sub>, mM) constant with R<sup>2</sup> 0.63 and the turnover number of nanozyme (K<sub>cat</sub>, s<sup>-1</sup>) with R<sup>2</sup> 0.80.
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
This resource will facilitate the design and optimization of nanomaterials with the desired catalytic activity and open new frontiers for nanozyme design. The data that support the findings of this study are openly available in this repository https://github.com/JuliaRJJ/DiZyme_ML
